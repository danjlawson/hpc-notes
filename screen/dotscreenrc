## .screenrc setup
## Basic usage:
# Copy this file to ~/.screenrc

## Usage from bash:
## Type `screen` to create a screen session.
## Type `screen -r` to rejoin a screen session.
## Type `screen -rd` if it won't let you because you forgot to detach it first.
## Within screen, type `exit` to close the current window. You can close all windows to exit screen.

## Key commands when using this setup:
# Control-b d: detach from screen. Then type `exit` to log off.
# Control-b <number>: switch window.
# Control-b Control-b: switch to last window (like alt-tab in windows)
# Control-b c: Create a new window.
# Control-b ?: show help.
# Control-b [: Enter copy mode. This lets you view your entire screen output history. Scroll around; press space to start a copy and space again to end it.
# Control-b ]: Paste copied text.


## Start:

# detach on hangup
autodetach on # if your ssh session closes, automatically detach screen from it.

# don't display the copyright page
startup_message off
escape ^Bb # Type Control-b to access screen commands (instead of the default Control-a, which messes with emacs)

## How to change window. The default is to type Control-b <number> where <number> will be listed at the bottom of the terminal window.
## These are options to change window with different keys.
#bindkey "^1;5Dd" prev  # change window with ctrl-left
#bindkey "^1;5Cc" next  # change window with ctrl-right

## I don't like the "bell" (screen flash)
#change visual bell
vbell_msg ""
vbellwait 0.5

## This ensures we always get something helpful displayed at the bottom. You will need to read the docs to understand it!
caption always "%?%{ Wk}%-Lw%?%{Rk}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%?%{Wk}%+Lw%? %{Rk}%=%d-%M-%Y %{rk}%c"
#hardstatus alwayslastline
#hardstatus string '%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{B}%Y-%m-%d %{W}%c %{g}]'

## On first creation we get three screens
# Default screens
screen -t shell1	1
screen -t shell2	2
screen -t shell3	3	
select 1

## Make the numbers sane. Note more than ten windows makes selecting them annoying.
bind c screen 1 # Window numbering starts at 1, not 0.
bind 0 select 10
